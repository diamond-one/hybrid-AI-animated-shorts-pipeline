## Overview

The **Hybrid AI Animated Shorts Pipeline Documentation** serves as a comprehensive guide for animation studios, creators, and enthusiasts interested in combining AI-powered tools with traditional animation techniques. This project provides a high-level overview of each production stage, using visual process diagrams and detailed descriptions to illustrate how AI tools can assist in generating assets, managing workflows, and enhancing creative output.

## Project Goals

- **Demonstrate AI-Enhanced Animation Workflows**: Showcase how AI can support various stages of animation production, from asset creation to final rendering.
- **Provide Clear Visuals and Descriptions**: Include process flow diagrams and visual aids to make complex workflows accessible.
- **Facilitate Understanding of Hybrid Pipelines**: Help animators and production teams visualize a collaborative workflow between AI tools and human input.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline consists of several distinct stages, each illustrated with diagrams and accompanied by descriptions:

1. **Pre-Production**: Scriptwriting, storyboarding, and initial asset planning are not included in this documentation, as the project already had animatics prepared.
2. **Asset Creation**: Using AI tools to generate character designs, backgrounds, and props, along with guidelines for integrating human-made assets.
3. **Motion Capture and Animation**: Setting up motion capture (mocap) for character animation, cleaning mocap data, and incorporating keyframe animation as necessary.
4. **Lighting and Visual Effects (VFX)**: Configuring lighting setups and adding special effects with rendering tools.
5. **Editing and Post-Production**: Combining rendered scenes, sound, and effects to produce the final short.

Each pipeline stage is supported by **Process Diagrams** that display task dependencies and team responsibilities, enhancing clarity and understanding.

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Explore Docs by Section**: Review each section’s visual diagrams to understand the process flow and the responsibilities within each stage.
2. **Apply Concepts to Your Workflow**: While generalized, the techniques and processes documented here can be adapted to fit a variety of animation projects.
