# Hybrid AI 3D Animation Pipeline 

Goal of the Pipeline:
The goal of this pipeline is to streamline the production of fast-paced, high-quality content for YouTube. By incorporating the latest AI technologies, it reduces production time and costs while maintaining excellent standards, giving creators a competitive edge. This repository outlines the process through clear workflows, Gantt charts, and feedback loops, showing how AI can enhance animation without sacrificing creativity or quality.
